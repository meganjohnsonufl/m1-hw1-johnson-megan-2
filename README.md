## About Me ##
Hi! My name is Megan Johnson. I'm a 32 year old from the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. I have a horse, am a dog aunt to a derpy Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, and spend my time either designing logos or photographing weddings and dog sports. I got my undergrad B.F.A. from Robert Morris University (Moon Township) and now I'm pursuing an M.A. from the University of Florida. I also have a certificate in UX/UI from Parsons The New School in New York City, New York.

## Past Coding Experience ##
My previous job working for a marketing and advertising agency required me to learn more coding and web development than any other job I've ever had. The requirement for my job with them was to train myself to design websites using WordPress and utilizing the Divi builder. By the time I was laid off from there, I had designed four websites for various clients. As problems arose with the websites, I used to have to solve them myself by research and implementing various voding. I used to dabble in HTML/CSS coding back in the early days of the internet as well.

## Career Goals ##
- I like to say my career goals are very broad and I am constantly molding them as I go. 
- I would love to potentially become an art director down the road and so many of those jobs require a master's degree. I am nervous of the amount of leadership and responsibility that comes with that position though. I've never been a leader type personality. 
- Another goal I have is just simply pursuing more web based jobs as a UX designer.
- I have an overwhelming desire to work in hospitality and tourism again or with a gaming developer.
